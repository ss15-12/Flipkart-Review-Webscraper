5,Wonderful,I think it is such a good product not only as per the quality but also the design is quite good . I m using this product from January ... In this pandamic situation it has became the most useful and helpful . Overall the bass and the sound quality is pretty good and another thing that will give you such a sigh of relief that it will provide a wire that will help you in case of lacking charges.,Nadia District,"Jun, 2020",609,88

4,Good choice,"awesome sound quality. pros 7-8 hrs of battery life (including 45 mins approx call time)Awesome sound output. Bass and treble are really very clear without equaliser. With equaliser, sound wary depends on the handset sound quality.Weightless to carry and in head tooMic is good, but in traffic it is not too good (3.25/5)3.5mm Option is really important to mention. Really expecting other leading brands to implement this.ConsVery tight in ears. adjusters are ok .. this ll be very tight...",Chennai,"Jul, 2018",2121,351

4,Really Nice,Good product..sound quality is good but bass is not so heavy as they are saying. I saw that this product has got 4.3 ratings then I placed order. Now truly saying that I am some of dissatisfied with this product. Bluetooth connectivity is good but I there is a huge lack can be shown when some music tracks are playing through Bluetooth. No issues for aux mode. Built quality is not so good. The main thing I was searching for a bass heavy headphones and they are saying that this is bass heavy so...,Howrah,"Jan, 2019",212,40
5,Must buy,"First of all, I want to talk about sound quality. The sound quality is best for this price segment. Bass is really punchy, mids are also good, but on high volumes, the sound cracks a bit,  otherwise it is really nice. 9/10.Then come the build quality. The build quality too is amazing. You cant get better headphones than these. They are sturdy and very light, made out of very good quality plastic. 9.5/10.The thing I didn't like was that they are a bit tight. Sometimes, they become uncomforta...",Zirakpur,"Oct, 2017",642,143
